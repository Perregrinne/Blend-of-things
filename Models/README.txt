Most of these are untextured. I don't have my own personal texture library or an application like Substance designer. I'd definitely like to get my hands on something like Armor Paint or Mixer and throw together some textures/materials for these models. I made (or started) these years ago when learning Blender. I think I was trying to make at least one model a day, but some were more complex than others and thus took more time. One of my goals was also to try and keep them relatively low-poly in case I used them in a game. Some were requests for low-poly assets for games that didn't usually work out (if you were wondering why bedpan is on the list, it was for a game that took place in a hospital). While sorting through these, I realized that the units aren't set to metric, as they should be, and therefore, the scale is likely off.
