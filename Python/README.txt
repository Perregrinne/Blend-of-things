These Python scripts were made years ago, and before Blender 2.8, so they aren't yet compatible with anything newer than 2.79. Also, some of them aren't finished or have not been refactored. I began them but usually only had time to work on them between classes or between the hours of 10:00PM and 5:00AM so don't expect the code to make sense, even if it's commented (especially if it's commented). I do plan to complete and refactor them hopefully in the nearby future when I get a little more free time. Of course, that includes making them 2.8x compatible. In the meantime, it won't do me any good to just have them sitting in my hard drives.
